### Built with

### What I learned

I learn about a css propertice which is mix-blend-mode that sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

figure {
    background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%); 
    border-radius: 12px  12px 0px 0px;  
    height: 15.15em;
}

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This helped me that here some property which is mix-blend-mode that you can mix an image and a background-color.
